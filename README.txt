# sort

just use this for reference on sorting algorithms

still in progress

refer to big O complexity chart
you can find a simplified version here: https://www.bigocheatsheet.com

Most of these array sorting algorithms here work for large datasets, however recursive algorithms wont if there is not enough RAM

Counting Sort is the fastest but loses efficiency when used to sort large datasets.  


NOTE: Exponential search algorithms are horribly inefficient and barely work in my experience.
